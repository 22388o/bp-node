# Bitcoin Transaction Services

This repository holds the source code for building the daemons that parse bitcoin blockchain blocks into a compact database based on LNPBP-4 standard and provides a query API for data that can't be provided by either Bitcoin Core and Electrum Server (like getting transaction spending particular output, quering transactions by their script/miniscript code etc).
